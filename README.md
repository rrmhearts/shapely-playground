# Shapely Playground

This project is simply to learn Shapely for my own purposes. Some functions have been written to simplify tasks transforming points or edges to polygons and vice-versa.

Sometimes shapely becomes more magical when paired with `networkx` and `sympy`. Some simple test materials concerning those libraries can be found under [extra/](./extra/).

These test functions were developed on my own for use in a larger project. Hope these are helpful to someone, including myself, down the road!
